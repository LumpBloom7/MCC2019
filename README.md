# MCC 2019 Solutions
These code files are my solutions to the problems in MCC 2019.

Each project comes with the test cases I received during MCC and the correct outcomes for each of them.

The list of problems are as follows:
* [Ascending](https://github.com/LumpBloom7/MCC2019/blob/master/_Problem%20Statements/Ascending.md)
* [Bakery](https://github.com/LumpBloom7/MCC2019/blob/master/_Problem%20Statements/Bakery.md)
* [Candy](https://github.com/LumpBloom7/MCC2019/blob/master/_Problem%20Statements/Candy.md)
* [Ditcoin](https://github.com/LumpBloom7/MCC2019/blob/master/_Problem%20Statements/Ditcoin.md)
* [Elimination](https://github.com/LumpBloom7/MCC2019/blob/master/_Problem%20Statements/Elimination.md)
* [Palindrome](https://github.com/LumpBloom7/MCC2019/blob/master/_Problem%20Statements/Palindrome.md)

The code for each problem may not be the most efficient method, and if you like to share your method instead, feel free to make a PR. Make sure you leave your name in a comment somewhere if you want to be credited.
